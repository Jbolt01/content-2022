  <WideBox>
    Both Wyden and Perkins support increased election security through mandated standards on a nationwide level such as implementing champion paper voting as a way to prevent foreign cybersecurity threat. However, the senators disagree on other issues relating to abortion and term limits. Perkins is openly pro-life and demands 12-year term limits in Congress. Wyden, on the other hand, is rated near 100% by multiple pro-abortion agencies and has been in congressional office for over 30 years.
