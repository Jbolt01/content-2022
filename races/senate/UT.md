## About Utah
With a population of three million, Utah is the 30th most populous state. Urban development is mostly concentrated in the Wasatch Front in the north central part of the state, and Washington Country in the southwest. For thousands of years, Utah has been inhabited by indigenous populations such as the ancient Puebloans, Ute, and Navajo. Many of Utah's first settlers after the Spanish were Mormon Americans fleeing government control. Over half of Utah's population are Mormon of whom a vast majority belong to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, making Utah the only state where a majority of the population belongs to a single church. This church greatly influences daily life and values, but the state has evolved to become more religiously diverse and secular since the 1990s. Utah has been listed as one of the fasted growing states since 2000, grouped as one of the overall best states in healthcare, governance, education, and infrustructure, and ranked as having the 14th-highest median average income with the least income inequality of any U.S. state.

    The incumbent, Mike Lee, rose out of the Republican primaries for a third time with a 62% win. By tying himself so closely to Trump, Lee could have made many Republican voters weary of voting for him.
