He is considered an average Republican member of Congress, meaning that he is very likely to vote with the Republican Party on the majority of bills. He is endorsed by Trump, and is a vocal supporter of the former president.

    #### Issues & controversies

    Paul is in favor of a Constitutional amendment limiting Senators to two terms, but is choosing to run again in 2022 regardless. Paul describes himself as “100% pro-life”, while Booker is endorsed by NARAL Pro-Choice America. Regarded as one of the most conservative senators, Paul is anti-vaccine, anti-gun control, anti-universal healthcare, and does not believe in climate change. Despite this, he is pro-legalization and pro-criminal justice reform due to his libertarian ideals of personal liberties. He is against the bi-partisan budget proposal, which Booker supports. Booker is Kentucky’s first black Democratic Senate nominee, and has called Paul out for blocking an anti-lynching bill from becoming federal law.
