    Top issues in the state are gun control, abortion, and the economy, with both candidates's views on each differing wildly. Incumbent Blumenthal’s approval rating has dipped to below 50% as inflation spiked and President Biden’s popularity tanked, leaving him in a vulnerable position for an incumbent.
