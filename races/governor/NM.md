  <WideBox>
    Grisham is pro-choice, and she recently reversed a state abortion ban that had been dormant due to Roe v. Wade. She also supports increased funding in healthcare and education, and she has also advocated against anti-immigrant policies. Ronchetti is a pro-life advocate, though he does support abortions up to 15 weeks after conception. He also seeks to make borders and cities safer, and advocates for increased funding in law enforcement as well as upholding Second Amendment rights. Ronchetti supports reform and increased funding in the education system, and argues that improving New Mexico’s education system will reduce its 19.1% poverty rate (the third highest in the country).
