  <WideBox>
    Hochul is pro-choice, while Zeldin is pro-life and saw the overturning of Roe v. Wade as a “victory for life, for family, for the Constitution, and for federalism.”

Both candidates believe in climate change, with Hochul especially putting an emphasis on funding renewable energy. Zeldin believed in the principles behind the Paris agreement, but did not vote to support it because he felt that the other countries involved were not pulling their own weight.
