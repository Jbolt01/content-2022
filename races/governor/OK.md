    Joy Hofmeister, Superintendent of Public Instruction in Oklahoma, is attempting to overthrow Kevin Stitt in a bid to become governor. She is the mastermind behind the “Oklahoma Edge” which is a 218-page strategic plan to meet specific Oklahoma education needs. She switched from being a Republican to being a Democrat in 2022 and as a result, is the only Democratic statewide elected official in Oklahoma.

  <WideBox>
    Some major issues and controversies pertinent to the Oklahoma gubernatorial election include abortion, criminal-justice reform, vaccination-rights, tax reform and relief for lower-income earners in Oklahoma (predominantly Indigenous people and farmers), and tribal relations with the Cherokee Nation. The biggest issue of the race is Stitt’s proposal to increase funding for voucher-school programs and his education-spending which Hofmeister believes will destroy the public education system. Hofmeister believes that money would better be spent toward public-education spending and teacher-salaries.
