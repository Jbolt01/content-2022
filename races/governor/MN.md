    Walz is pro-choice, and issued an executive order that supported those in other states seeking an abortion in Minnesota. Walz supports police reform, although he has increased funding for local law enforcement. He has enacted environmentally friendly policies, including the Clean Car rule, which aims to bring more fuel-efficient cars to Minnesota. He is also “pushing for 100% of Minnesota’s electricity to come from renewable energy by the year 2040. ” Under Walz, Minnesota is fifth in the nation in job growth and the lowest in unemployment. 
Jensen is strongly pro-life, stating early in his campaign he would “try to ban abortion.” He also favors increased law enforcement, active use of the national guard, and harsher penalties for those convicted of violent crimes. Jensen has stated he would repeal the Clean Car rule. For the economy, Jensen favors decreased government spending and would like to reduce gas prices.
