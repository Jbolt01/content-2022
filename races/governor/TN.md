    Is the current incumbent governor for Tennessee. In the 2020 election, Gov. Lee didn’t issue an endorsement for Trump - although he supported his nomination of Amy Coney Barrett and shares a number of his positions on controversial issues. On his website, one will find that he claims to have “passed the most pro-life legislation in the country.” He has supported capital punishment and since holding office, his state has executed seven people. Lee considers himself a social conservative - and puts emphasis on his Christian faith. Many of the positions he holds are that of a typical conservative today.

    #### Issues & controversies

  <WideBox>
   There isn’t much controversy going on here. In 2020, Bill Lee passed some controversial legislation that prevents transgender people from using the bathroom of their preferred identity. The topic of LGBTQ+ rights and the movement in support of it has become more prominent and grown since then - however the attitude of many republicans (Lee’s general voter base) has stayed the same, so it likely will have a minimal effect.
