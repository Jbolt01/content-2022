  <WideBox>
    Whitmer is reiterating what she’s done in the past and will be focusing on small business relief, opening more job opportunities, better Wi-Fi access, reproductive rights, less crimes, and improving infrastructure. 
Dixon is pro-life and strongly supports the 2nd Amendment. She wants to focus on increasing the amount of jobs, improving school, handling crime and public safety. She also wants to improve infrastructure like roads, increase business, and reduce income tax. 
In early May 2020, Whitmer announced she would be extending the stay-at-home mandate until May 15, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In response, gun-armed protestors rallied at the Michigan state capitol building. Later in October 2020, it was revealed that a group was planning to kidnap Whitmer, with the goal of inciting a national rebellion in anticipation of the 2020 presidential election. The plan was unsuccessful, and two men were recently convicted for the planned kidnapping. Dixon has since joked about the incident on multiple occasions during her campaign. Overall, Dixon is very right-wing and Trump-endorsed. She opposes abortion, and when asked about underage rape victims has spoken of the “bond” and “healing” from birth. For Michigan voters, education is a key issue on the ballot. Dixon has voiced support for the Opportunity Scholarship program, which was pushed by former Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos but vetoed by Whitmer.
