## About Wyoming
Wyoming is the least populous state in the US, and is known for being one of the two essentially-rectangular states, along with Colorado. Situated in the Mountain West, its landscape is a mix of mountain rangelands and prairies. It was the first state to grant women suffrage, which gave it the nickname "The Equality State". Historically, it was known for its ranching, but today its economy relies on fossil fuel extraction and tourism to its beautiful vistas.

    #### Issues & controversies

  <WideBox>
    During his term as governor, Gordon has come in conflict multiple times with Donald Trump, who called him “not too helpful.” One of Gordon’s flagship projects in the wake of the pandemic is the “Energy Rebound Program,” which provides relief funding for oil and gas businesses. He advocates for lean government, and boasts the smallest state expenditures in a decade. He also objects to many federal government programs that he perceives as interfering with states rights, such as the Green New Deal, and has filed numerous lawsuits to stop those laws and regulations. Overall, he’s very big on energy, and Wyoming’s energy is mostly fossil fuels.

    After announcing her candidacy in May of this year, Livingston campaigned on women’s healthcare rights, education reform, and marijuana  decriminalization. She advocates for moving government incentives away from Wyoming’s large fossil fuels industry and towards renewable energy. She wants more women and younger people involved in government, and decided to run “because someone had to stand up for women’s rights.” She has mentioned support for Medicare/Medicaid expansion, as well as mental health care in the state.
