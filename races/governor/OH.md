    DeWine has been the Ohio State Senator from 1981-1982, Ohio Senator from 1995-2007, Attorney General of Ohio from 2011-2019, and Governor from 2019-present. Because of facing backlash from Republicans for implementing strict COVID-19 restrictions, such as a stay at home order and mask mandates, he was challenged by Jim Renacci (R) for the Republican primaries. This was the first incumbent Ohio governor to face a primary challenger since Michael Disalle in 1962. At first Renacci was winning, but then DeWine took a lead by attacking President Joe Biden's policies and signing Constitutional carry into law.
