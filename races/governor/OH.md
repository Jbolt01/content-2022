    DeWine has been the Ohio State Senator from 1981-1982, Ohio Senator from 1995-2007, Attorney General of Ohio from 2011-2019, and Governor from 2019-present. Because of facing backlash from Republicans for implementing strict COVID-19 restrictions, such as a stay at home order and mask mandates, he was challenged by Jim Renacci (R) for the Republican primaries. This was the first incumbent Ohio governor to face a primary challenger since Michael Disalle in 1962. At first Renacci was winning, but then DeWine took a lead by attacking President Joe Biden’s policies and signing Constitutional carry into law.

    Ohio nuclear bribery scandal, where FirstEnergy, an electric utility company, paid millions in bribes to Republican legislators to develop legislation favorable to them, which was signed by DeWine. Since The US Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade gave power to the states, many abortion-rights supporters, especially women, voted against Republicans such as DeWine.
