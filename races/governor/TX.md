  <WideBox>
    In 2021, Abbot signed a critical race theory bill to limit education about race and America's history of slavery, and additionally calling school literature about sexuality "pornographic content. Further, he defended investigations into parents of transgender children on the basis that gender-affirming care is child abuse. In this race, he focuses on developing a stronger border security plan, working on natural disaster preparation, and emphasizing the importance of small businesses and capital investment growth. In the past, Oâ€™Rourke turned away immigrants at Texas's borders to control Covid-19. He was also a member of the Cult of the Dead Cow as a teenager, a hacktivist group. His campaign is based on his accusations of incumbent Republicans for doing nothing against gun violence. And although he became ill with bacterial infection in early August, he continues to support marijuana legalization, is fighting to pass the first comprehensive nondiscrimination law for the LGBTQ+ community, and wants to ensure suitable healthcare, education, criminal justice, and voting rights for those with disabilities.
